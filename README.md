# stackFinal Integration instruction

This project contains the following components: A paging MongoDB database running in a docker container and deployed to AWS via Lightsail. An AWS lambda in order to use Amazon Simple Email Service to contact with the developer team. A Cognit User Pool to manage the registed users. A web application for users implement using vaadin framework.

Microservice: Quarkus microservice with complete CRUD operations compiled to jvm-jar and running in a docker container deployed to AWS via Lightsail on the same Lightsail instances as MongoDB.

AWS Lambda: Integrate a AWS Lambda with a Vaadin-Spring, deployed to AWS via SAM, and configured to use API-Gateway and SES.

Cognito User Pools: This app integrates user management using Cognito User Pools and is able to scale to an infinite number of users. Instead of saving the user's email as a field in each of the mongo records, and then when querying the DB, filtering only those records that match that user's email.

Vaadin Web Client: This bookshelf web application with full CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations on the Google Book model. It integrates a 3rd party RESTful and searchable API -- Google Book API. Once the user finds a favorite item, he may add/delete/update that item in a list of items displayed in the app.

## Quarkus
This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

### local
#### To use MongoDB locally:
```shell script
docker run -ti --rm -d -p 27017:27017 mongo:4.0
```
#### To run locally:
You can run the application in dev mode that enables live coding using:

./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
```

### remote
#### To use MongoDB remotely:
Use Lightsail - MongoDB with Image 'mongo:4.0' and port and protocol '27014', 'HTTP'
#### To run remotely:
```shell script
docker build -f src/main/docker/Dockerfile.jvm -t {yourDockerHubID}/{a-name-you-like} .
docker upload {yourDockerHubID}/{a-name-you-like}
```
Use Lightsail - Quarkus with Image '{yourDockerHubID}/{a-name-you-like}' and port and protocol '8080', 'HTTP'
